Description: Like duplexer but using streams3
 This is a reimplementation of duplexer using the Streams3 API
 which is standard in Node as of v4. Everything largely works the same
 Duplexer takes a writable stream and a readable stream and makes them
 appear as a readable writable stream.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
